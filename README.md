# CaptureMonitor
CaptureMonitor is a project in Python language base in the greater part on win32api.
At the beginning of my coding path in this technology I wanted to grab the cursor position and create a screen shot from the monitor.
It will help me find unexpected errors during manual testing.

Requirements:
- grab mouse event (left, right , wheel click) and keybord events.
- detect display device and monitor params.
- make capture from the monitor after push and down
